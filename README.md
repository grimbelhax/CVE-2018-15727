# CVE-2018-15727

Here I wrote a MSF Module for [CVE-2018-15727](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15727) which is an auth bypass for Grafana with LDAP/OAuth authentification enabled. It's already integrated in the [metasploit-framework repository](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/auxiliary/admin/http/grafana_auth_bypass.py). This module generates a remember me cookie for a valid username. Through unpropper seeding while userdate are requested from LDAP or OAuth it's possible to craft a valid remember me cookie. This cookie can be used for bypass authentication for everyone knowing a valid username.
